ABSTRACT

In statistics, there are two approaches to model fitting. This study applied both approaches, the
Classical and Bayesian (using Markov chain Monte Carlo), in fitting Generalized Linear Models,
GLM. We considered fitting the GLM using 3 distributions from the exponential family of dis-
tribution; the Normal, Binomial and Poisson. Results showed that both approaches used gave
quite similar model parametersâ€™ values. The Mean squared error, Akaike Information Criteria and
Bayesian Information Criteria were used as tools to select the best model distribution. Based
on the mortality data used, the Binomial and Poisson distributions are most appropriate as the
model distributions as they both had the least MSE.
